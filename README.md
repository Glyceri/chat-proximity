# Chat Proximity

Chat Proximity is an innovative plugin designed to enhance the realism and immersion of in-game communication by dynamically altering the visibility of chat messages based on the physical distance between players.

## Features:

- Proximity Detection: Messages from players who are nearby appear in bright white, ensuring clear and immediate visibility.
- Dynamic Shading: As players move further apart, the messages gradually transition into shades of grey, providing a visual cue of the sender's distance. The further away the player is, the darker the message appears.

## Benefits:

- Enhanced Immersion: Adds a layer of realism to the game by simulating real-world communication dynamics, where voices (or messages) become less clear with distance.
- Improved Gameplay Experience: Encourages players to stay closer for clearer communication or strategically manage their distance based on the context of the game.
- Visual Clarity: Easily distinguish between nearby and distant communications at a glance, improving situational awareness.
